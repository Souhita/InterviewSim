                Well, I’m currently an account executive at Smith, where I handle our top-performing client. Before that, I worked at an agency where I was on three different major national healthcare brands. And while I really enjoyed the work that I did, I’d love the chance to dig in much deeper with one specific healthcare company, which is why I’m so excited about this opportunity with Metro Health Center.</label>

                Well, I am currently living in an apartment about thirty minutes away. I enjoy talking walks and playing minigolf. I’m really excited about this job opportunity. I have had experience in this field before but just very briefly.</label>

                I have two brothers and a sister. I'm the youngers of all of them and i’m the first person in my family to go to college. Some things I spend my free time doing is playing video games and watching youtube videos.</label>

                I have gone to school for 4 years and changed my major 4 times. I find that I’m really good at doing this type of jobs. So, i’m really hoping i can get this job because I’m really excited for it. During college I made many new friends so I believe my communication skills are great. I know that I will be a good team worker and get along with everyone.</label>
